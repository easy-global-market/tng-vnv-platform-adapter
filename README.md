# tng-vnv-platform-adapter
5GTANGO repository for the VnV Platform Adapter


An Adapter for VnV to talk to various Service Platforms. Out of the box support is currently for the following service platforms:
* [SONATA](http://www.sonata-nfv.eu/)
* [OSM](https://osm.etsi.org/)
* [ONAP](https://www.onap.org/)


In the 5GTANGO V&V Platform the Platform Adapter plays the role of an connector between the V&V testing framework and the Service Orchestrator/Service Platform.
The Platform Adapter allows packages, tests and results to  be managed regardless of the chosen Service Platform used to orchestrate the services. 
It exposes interfaces to manage service and VNF instances, retrieve monitoring information about the infrastructure status, reserve resources for services deployment.
The repo is organized into three main directories;

## Repository Structure
  
 * `adapters` contains the python code to  communicate with downstream service platform 
 * `models` contains the VIM/WIM Wrappers files.
 * `packages` contains the VIM/WIM Wrappers files.
